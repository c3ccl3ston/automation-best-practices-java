### Testing for Good serves 2 purposes:

1. To pay it forward to the testing world and help us all upskill üöÄ
2. For us all to help a cause greater than ourselves üåç

### [About Black Girls CODE](https://www.blackgirlscode.com/about-us/)

We build pathways for young women of color to embrace the current tech marketplace as builders and creators by 
introducing them to skills in computer programming and technology.

Radical action is needed if we are to close the opportunity gap for Black women and girls. We lead a global movement to 
establish equal representation in the tech sector. Black Girls CODE is devoted to showing the world that Black girls can
code and do so much more. Together, we are creating stronger economies and more equitable societies‚Äîultimately realizing
the true potential of democracy through diversity and inclusion.

üëâ While the event is free, Sauce Labs encourages all attendees to 
[donate to Black Girls Code](https://www.gofundme.com/f/testing-for-good-workshop-black-girls-code). Sauce Labs Office 
of Inclusion & Sustainability will match donations up to $2500.

## Setup

### Sign up for account

[![Sauce Labs](https://img.shields.io/badge/SauceLabs-AC1414?style=for-the-badge&logo=saucelabs&logoColor=white)](https://saucelabs.com/sign-up)

### Get your username and api key

- Save your Sauce Labs Username and Access Key by going to the [Sauce Labs user settings page](https://app.saucelabs.com/user-settings)

### Gitpod setup

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io#https://github.com/c3ccl3ston/automation-best-practices-java)

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Gitpod lets you run an entire Dev environment from a browser! You can use this approach if you don't 
> know how to set up a local Java environment.

1. Once the Gitpod.io URL is loaded, you will need to sign in with the GitHub account you created earlier
2. Once the development environment is loaded, you should see 'Ready to test!' in the Terminal window in the lower 
portion of the window, run the following commands in that Terminal to set your `SAUCE_USERNAME` and `SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY`:

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è You can get your Sauce Labs Username and Access Key by going to the [Sauce Labs user settings page](https://app.saucelabs.com/user-settings)

```bash
eval $(gp env -e SAUCE_USERNAME=<sauce_username>)
eval $(gp env -e SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY=<sauce_access_key>)
```

> Replace <sauce_username> and <sauce_access_key> with your credentials

Once you have run those 2 commands, you can run the following commands to test your environment variables:

```bash
echo $SAUCE_USERNAME
echo $SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY
```

Run sanity tests

```bash
mvn test -Dtest=E2ETests -X
```
